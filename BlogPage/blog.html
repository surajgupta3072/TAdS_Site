                            </h3>
                            Most trekkers know Har Ki Dun for its culture and history and trek to only Har Ki Dun but end up missing out on the beauty and variety the Ruinsara Tal has to offer. This is one of the most underrated sections of the trek. In less than five minutes of starting your trek, you find yourself on an undulating trail right beside the Thamsa river. You are constantly under a canopy of fresh green. Quaint old wooden bridges across the river appear out of nowhere giving you great picture opportunities. You cover miles on this trail without breaking a sweat. You’ll notice that the coniferous forest gets denser as you go further. The narrow trail snakes through this dense dark forest for a good hour before opening up to the traces of civilization — the ancient village of Gangad. We are not used to such leafy starts on treks. It was almost like a walk in a picture-perfect pine tree park.

                            You never hear trekkers talk about any campsite on the Har Ki Dun trek. Like everyone else, I assumed Kalkatiyadhar to either be a small settlement or just beside it. Quite contrary to my expectations, Kalkatiyadhar turned out to be a vast green meadow. What blew me away was the expanse of the valley. We were in the middle of multi-level cricket-field-sized meadows, set at a vantage height. To my distant left, the trail climbed towards Swargrohini peaks, which were just peeking on the horizon. To my far right were dense jungles with mountains rising behind them. This was the trail to Ruinsara. To my right across the river was a meadow set amidst a boundary of pine trees. Behind me, I could trace the trail all the way down to Seema and even see the Kedarkantha summit miles away behind Kotgaon.

                            A lot has been said everywhere about the ancient villages of Har Ki Dun. You spot these villages from a distance, spread out on the mountainside, with houses almost hanging in the air. I could not wait to climb up to them and see what the interiors looked like. Spending a night in the village home takes you back hundreds of years. The stories of the village elders and the smiles of the youngsters are something that you want to capture and take back with you. The villages complete the famed Har Ki Dun experience. On our trek, you get to stay in at least two different villages – Gangad and Osla.

                            I loved the expanse of the Har Ki Dun valley. The valley has everything going for it. Big snow-clad mountains towering right in front of you. A big river flowing right in the middle. Lovely green meadows stretching far and wide. I could sit there and just take in this scene the whole day. Ruinsara Tal on the other hand feels like a faraway world. The isolation grips you. It’s just you, the mountains and the lake. Looking at the mountains reflecting in the clear blue lake had a big calming effect on me. Devs Thatch turned out to be the best-kept secret of the entire Har Ki Dun – Ruinsara trail. You hardly see much of this meadow from anywhere else but when inside it. The secret is indeed well wrapped around by pine trees! I loved the meadows because they flow down from top to bottom for 600 meters and stretch for almost 2 km in length. Flowering bushes border the meadows throughout while tiny colorful flowers grow from the ground almost everywhere in spring.

                        The splendor of nature, the stillness in the valleys, the astounding views of the night sky, the ardent display of colors during the sunset, the delight of staying in the tents out there in open, etc. had always fascinated me. However, I had not realized that a trek experience can teach us so much about LIFE!

                        On 13th of September as per the plan we need to start our journey for Baraadsar lake trek. The trek of Baraadsar lake is located at an altitude of 4400 meters between Rupin and Supin valley in the Himalayas. We rent a car from Dehradun and started heading towards Himri in the afternoon. It was a 7-hour drive through Purola village. All four of us knew driving and it was very easy. We reached there at around 10 pm and camped there. The splashing sound of Rupin river over there was really amazing and we enjoyed it a lot.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        The next day, we traveled to Bheetri village. The trek started there actually crossing beautiful villages and a pond to reach Kurla thach. Kurla thach is a grassy meadow located at a height of 2600 meters and it is home to Gujjars. The view over there was fascinating and we took many photos from there. This place is surrounded by forests. We made a tent and stayed there. On the next day, we were actually leaving the forest area . The ascent trek started and reached the top of the mountain face. Then we crossed a ridge and reached Eitikat Odi which is the junction between Rupin and Supin valley. Realized that it will be a trouble for beginners and we won't recommend it for them. We continued the trek after taking a rest.

                    <p>
                        The trek to Dalhar started the next day. Dalhar is a grassy top that offered us a splendid view of snow-capped peaks. That was truly a feast for our eyes. We could see  Kedar Kantha peak on one side and Sewa village on the other side from this spot. After spending some time there, we moved to reach Devbasa. It is a campsite situated at a height of 3650 meters.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        Then came the most challenging part of our trek; from Devbasa to Baraadsar campsite which was our final destination. It was mostly uphill with a steep climb to Baraadsar Ridge. The climb was literally more tricky than we expected and we encountered snow and glaciers on our way. But we all had a strong desire to reach the top and it motivated us. Finally, we reached the top and its beauty proved that our efforts were worth it. Such an amazing view!!! It was so beautiful that we could not get our eyes off it! We took a lot of pictures and it was very exciting.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        On 17th, we started our return journey back to Dehradun. That was also slightly challenging. We carefully walked to Devbasa and camped at Sara forest. It took 2 days. After that, we went for a small trek to Boincha and Jakhol and finally reached Dehradun.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        The view over there was splendid and will remain a beautiful experience for all of us.
